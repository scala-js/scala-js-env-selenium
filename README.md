# scalajs-env-selenium

[![Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/assets/badges/scalajs-0.6.6.svg)](https://www.scala-js.org/)

## Usage
Simply add the following line to your `project/plugins.sbt`:
```
libraryDependencies += "org.scala-js" %% "scalajs-env-selenium" % "0.1.0"
```
and the following line to your sbt settings:
```
jsEnv := new org.scalajs.jsenv.selenium.SeleniumJSEnv(BROWSER)
```
where the `BROWSER` can be either `org.scalajs.jsenv.selenium.Firefox` or
`org.scalajs.jsenv.selenium.Chrome`.

When executing the program with `run` a new browser window will be created,
the code will be executed in it and finally the browser will close itself.
All the console outputs will appear in SBT as usual. Executing `test` will open
several browser windows and close them all before the end of the tests.

### In browser debugging
If you wish to keep the browser window opened after the execution has terminated simply
add the option `withKeepAlive` on the environment (`new SeleniumJSEnv(BROWSER).withKeepAlive()`).
It is recommend to use this with a `run` and not `test` because the latter tends
to leave too many browser windows open.

### Additional requirements for Google Chrome
Selenium requires an additional driver to connect to Google Chrome.
This driver can be found at https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/.
You will also need to make sure the driver location is in the systems `PATH` variable.
